## Community Apps
The community has built some great applications. Have a look at them for inspiration, or even better, contribute to them and make them better! Reach out to the developers and see how you can help.


### Android Applications
These are Android Applications for DHIS2. Most are Java or Kotlin, but some are written in React Native or other technologies.

<GridBlockContainer>
    <FullWidthComponent
        image={"https://placekitten.com/400/201"}
        title="Example Title"
        description="Example Description"
        url="example_url"
    />
    <FullWidthComponent
        image={"https://placekitten.com/302/200"}
        title="Example Title"
        description="Example Description"
        url="example_url"
    />
</GridBlockContainer>

### Standalone Applications
These are standalone applications that are not intended to be embedded in a DHIS2 instance, but work remotely. 

<GridBlockContainer>
    <FullWidthComponent
        image={"https://placekitten.com/311/199"}
        title="Example Title"
        description="Example Description"
        url="example_url"
    />
    <FullWidthComponent
        image={"https://placekitten.com/322/200"}
        title="Example Title"
        description="Example Description"
        url="example_url"
    />
</GridBlockContainer>

### Web Applications
These apps are built by the community and are not yet ready for the app hub. They can be a good starting point for your apps, but more importantly can use your help to get them ready for the app hub and to improve them.
