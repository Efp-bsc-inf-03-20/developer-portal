### DHIS2 Developer Meetups

We are also hosting monthly meetups, every **second Thursday of the Month** with the DHIS2 Developer Community and the DHIS2 Core Team.

#### What are these meetups?

A series of online and informal meetings with the DHIS2 Developer Community. These meetups are a great way for developers working on DHIS2-related projects to connect, ask questions and stay updated.

Keep an eye on the CoP [Development](https://community.dhis2.org/c/development/10) category for our next Developer Meetup.

Looking forward to seeing you there! ðŸŽŠ
